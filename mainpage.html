this is the main page for programming languages Basically, it is a method that facilitates the programmer to write his program in the form of instructions and commands that the computer understands in order to carry out the required work. It is known that the computer converts the language in which the programming is written into a string of 0 and 1, for you to understand
The programming process follows rules specific to the language chosen by the programmer.

Each language has its own characteristics that distinguish it from the other and make it suitable to varying degrees for each type of program and the task required of this program.

Programming languages ​​also have common characteristics and common borders, since all of these languages ​​were designed to interact with the computer
Programming languages ​​are divided according to their proximity to human languages ​​into:

A high-level language such as: C#, Python, and Java.
low level language لغة
Ex: assembly language.
Unlike human languages, which can be understood even with some errors, programming languages ​​are not that flexible. Just a small error in the program is like forgetting; Or any simple error, the program will not work.
Perhaps this is one of the defects of the programming language from my point of view, as a simple mistake may cause complete disruption of work, and for programming languages ​​there are types, the most famous of which are Java and C++
